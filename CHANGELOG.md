# Changelog

## Unreleased

- You can now set custom CSS ids for admonishment blocks with the `id` field.
- You can now customize the default CSS id prefix (default is `"admonition-"`).

## 1.13.1

### Changed

- Bumped internal `mdbook` version to `0.4.35` ([#142](https://github.com/tommilligan/mdbook-admonish/pull/142))

### Fixed

- Relaxed `clap` dependency to fix compilation error when using other `mdbook-*` plugins. Thanks to [@joshka](https://github.com/joshka) for the [report](https://github.com/tommilligan/mdbook-admonish/pull/141)! ([#142](https://github.com/tommilligan/mdbook-admonish/pull/142))

## 1.13.0

### Changed

- Required styles version is now `^3.0.0` (release `1.13.0`). Run `mdbook-admonish install` to update.
- Internal CSS classnames for directives are now prefixed with `admonish-`, so `warning` is now `admonish-warning`. This avoids a conflict with upstream classnames introduced in `mdbook 0.4.35`. Thanks to [@phoenixr-codes](https://github.com/phoenixr-codes) for the report and fix! ([#139](https://github.com/tommilligan/mdbook-admonish/pull/139))
